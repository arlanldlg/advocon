# Advocon

Advocon is a platform that aims to ease the organization of outreach programs and select public 
events. With the assistance of Advocon, organizers can dissiminate their event to reach more people 
who are looking to assist in public service. 

Organize outreach programs to locations that are in need of help. These events could be setup by 
foundations that have teamed up with Advocon to advertise these occasions sponsored by them to get 
the attention of willing participants who will partake in said events.

Team up with your friends, family, school, or organization. Create Teams ranging from your group of 
friends, to your whole student body. From small tight knit groups that plan to operate in small 
communities, to large scale operations that can cover whole barangays.

Why stop there, keep on planning little events that you and your friends could easily partake in 
without the aid of an outside foundation. Provided that you know who you're talking to.
With Advocon, giving the extrahand that your fellow kabayan needs has never been easier. Join in 
committing "Bayanihan" and make a difference in the Philippines.
